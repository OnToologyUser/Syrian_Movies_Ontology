# Syrian Cinema Data Ontology

This repository contains the ontology for Syrian cinema data, a structured representation of information about Syrian movies, actors, directors, and more. The ontology is designed to provide a standardized way to describe and categorize Syrian cinema, facilitating the integration of this data into the Semantic Web.

## Overview

The ontology is built using the Web Ontology Language (OWL), a semantic web language designed to represent rich and complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations between things. It is designed to be used with the Semantic Web, which is a system of data and information that is structured and interlinked, making it easier for computers to understand and process.

## Structure

The ontology is organized into several key classes and properties, including:

- **Movie**: Represents a Syrian movie, with properties such as title, release date, director, and genre.
- **Actor**: Represents an actor in a Syrian movie, with properties such as name and gender.
- **Director**: Represents a director of a Syrian movie, with properties such as name and nationality.
- **Producer**: Represents a producer of a Syrian movie, with properties such as name and nationality.
- **Payment**: Represents the financial aspects of a movie, including costs and revenue.

## Usage

To use this ontology, you can import it into your preferred ontology editor or reasoner. The ontology is designed to be used with tools that support OWL, such as Protégé, Apache Jena, or any other OWL-compatible tool.
